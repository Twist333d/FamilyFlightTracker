Certainly! Structuring Phase 1 into manageable and testable increments is an excellent approach to ensure each part of your project is functional and reliable. Let's break down Phase 1 of your app into key increments:

### Phase 1 Breakdown: Flight Information App

#### Increment 1: Basic Flask Web Server

##### Objective
Set up a basic Flask web server to serve as the foundation of your app.

##### Tasks
1. **Initialize a Flask Application**: Create a simple Flask app that can display a basic webpage.
2. **Run the Server Locally**: Ensure the Flask server runs and can be accessed through a web browser.

##### Test
Access the local server via a web browser to confirm you see a basic webpage (e.g., a "Hello, World!" message).

#### Increment 2: User Interface for Flight Number Input

##### Objective
Develop a user interface where users can input a flight number.

##### Tasks
1. **Create Input Form**: Design a simple HTML form in Flask to accept a flight number.
2. **Handle Form Submission**: Set up Flask to handle POST requests from this form.

##### Test
Submit a flight number through the form and ensure the backend correctly receives it (initially, just print it to the console).

#### Increment 3: Integrate Flight Data API

##### Objective
Integrate a flight data API to fetch flight details based on the provided flight number.

##### Tasks
1. **API Selection and Setup**: Choose a flight data API and set it up (e.g., get an API key).
2. **Implement API Call**: Implement the logic to make a request to the flight data API with the submitted flight number.
3. **Display Flight Information**: Show basic flight information on the webpage after submission.

##### Test
Enter a flight number, submit it, and verify that the corresponding flight information is displayed on the webpage.

#### Increment 4: Basic Calendar Event Creation

##### Objective
Create a basic calendar event based on the flight details.

##### Tasks
1. **Integrate Google Calendar API**: Set up and integrate the Google Calendar API.
2. **Event Creation Logic**: Develop the functionality to create a calendar event with the flight information.
3. **Email Calendar Invite**: Send an email with the calendar event to a predefined email address.

##### Test
Check that a calendar event is created and an invite is sent to the specified email after submitting a flight number.

### Starting with Increment 1: Basic Flask Web Server

Let's begin with the first chunk, setting up a basic Flask web server.

#### Step-by-Step for Increment 1

1. **Initialize Flask App**:
   - Create a new Python file (e.g., `app.py`).
   - Write the Flask setup code:
     ```python
     from flask import Flask

     app = Flask(__name__)

     @app.route('/')
     def index():
         return "<h1>Hello, World!</h1>"

     if __name__ == '__main__':
         app.run(debug=True)
     ```

2. **Run the Flask App**:
   - Run `app.py` in your development environment.
   - Ensure your Flask server starts without errors.

3. **Access the Webpage**:
   - Open a web browser.
   - Go to `http://localhost:5000`.
   - You should see "Hello, World!" displayed.

Once you have this basic server running, you've successfully completed Increment 1. Let me know when you're ready to move on to Increment 2, or if you encounter any issues or have questions!
